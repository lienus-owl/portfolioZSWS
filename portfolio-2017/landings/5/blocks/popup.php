     <h3>About an author</h3>
     <p>Born in Ekibastuz, Kazakhstan, Pavel spent his childhood in the small town of Pavlovsk, located in the Voronezh region. In school, Pavel was interested in folk dance, chess, and athletics. Love for sport and aspirations for more prompted Pavel to leave the Moscow Circus School (he was an excellent student). He immediately found a job, touring internationally with the Great Moscow Circus. </p>
    <p>Four years later, completing circus school, Pavel joined the Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard. After performing in different circus festivals around Europe and Asia, he was invited to Montreal, Canada, by Cirque Du Soleil. As part of a group of tightrope walkers, Pavel joined the creation of Cirque Du Soleil’s new show, “Totem.” </p>
    <p>After five years of work in the best circus in the World, and received a shoulder injury, Pavel decides to leave the Cirque du Soleil.</p>
    <p>He sold the copyright to use his numbers in the show Totem and went home to the city of St-Petersburg. There, he took the time to treat his shoulder and recover from surgery after finishing his Australian leg of the Cirque tour. </p>

     <p>Topics that we cover in the workshop depend on the audience that is going to a seminar. See the description of different levels of training. A maximum number of participants in a group - 15 people. Each session is 4 hours. In the day I can make two groups. </p>
      <p>So now about the conditions of our possible cooperation. My fee for holding 2 groups (4 hours each) - $ 3000; or 4 groups (4 hours each) - 5000 $; + flight and hotel accommodation (minimum 4 star). Ideally, make your gym was close to the hotel. It will remove from your load of my transfer. All negotiations for the workshop starts after the 30% deposit. Before receiving this amount of money, I do not plan the date nor do I tell anyone that this event will take place. </p>
      <p>The best options for pre-promotion of the event is to promote the video with my act in Cirque du Soleil. Potential participants are added to my friends in the social networks. It is best to learn and understand my approach, the technique with my work, then we inform about the possibility of taking part of the workshop in your city. Other options are possible, but not so effective. Therefore, if I have friends there are at least 30-100 people from your region - it makes sense to write me and make a prepayment. If not, you must first be engaged in the promotion of the video, and then write the proposal. Once you have made an advance payment and we have agreed on the confirmed date, then we will move forward with the media to start working with them. That's all you need to know for a successful organization. Nothing strengthens the belief in a man as a booking deposit in time :)))) </p>

      <p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">ATTENTION!</b> If you do not comply with the terms of the agreement about the hotel, location, and payment, we reserve the right in the same order to move away from the conditions of the agreements and unilaterally cancel the workshop. The prepayment amount is retained as compensation for time reserved and non-refundable. All obligations for reimbursement of expenses to participants of the failed workshop remain with the organizers.</p>
